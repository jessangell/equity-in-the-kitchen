              Although half of culinary school students are female, less than 7 
              percent of professional chefs are women. If they do get a 
              professional job, they are likely to be paid less than their 
              counterpart. There are sections in the food industry however that
              are making strides to address general equality. On this website, 
              I am sharing a list of successful women in food media, writing, 
              and hospitality. I hope this tool will inspire you to share this 
              knowledge with others and lead the way to racial equity.<br /><br />

              Alice Louise Waters is a chef, activist, restaurateur, and author.
              She is most widely known for starting the farm-to-table movement, 
              which encourages the use of local, organic produce in restaurants and
              home cooking. This movement reduces the amount of waste in the food 
              industry, and also encourages healthy, clean eating. She started her
              organization The Edible Schoolyard Project in 1995 to educate 
              students about nutrition and sustainable food. Its comprehensive 
              program teaches students gardening, food choices, and healthy recipes. 
              She is an inspiration to not only to me but also young children all over
              the world.
